# ShapeAI_Python_Machine_Learning
Hi, This is Sachin S. This repository was made on behalf of submission of my project for the bootcamp organised by Devtown for Machine Learning
The Instructor during the session was Mr.Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to learn
a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.
<br>I got to have hands on experience on;
<li>python
<li>Machine Learning
<br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that 
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit;
